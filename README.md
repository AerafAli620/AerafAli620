### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Aeraf Ali and I am doing Bachelorâ€™s in Cyber Security from Air University Islamabad.
I am a Web Pen Tester, Web & Software Developer. I enjoy using my skills to contribute to the exciting technological advances.

My specialties include quick learning new skills, programming languages and problem solving. So far, I have Python, C++, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and WordPress under my belt. I'm still enthusiastically grabbing onto other programming languages, frameworks and principles that I can integrate into coding web in my head.
